# PrioriTask, a full-stack To-Do App

Built using **React**, **Node.js** with the **Express.js** framework and **MySQL**.

Users can enter their tasks, set the category and priority and display them in the to-do block below. The app loads all the tasks from the database at launch.

The goal of the project was to practice full-stack web development. Purely educational.
